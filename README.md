# teams_creator
This app creates teams from a list of participants and assigns a team captain. 

To make this work you need to go to your invitation in outlook on a windows machine. Go to tracking and copy the status to clipboard. Open the responses.txt, get rid of the current content and paste your clipboard. Then you can run main.py and it will give you teams with a captain and members.
