# teams_creator
This app creates teams from a list of participants, assigns a team captain and defines a team name (adjective + craft)

## Background
In our company we organise fun stuff every now and then. Every body gets an invite in Outlook which they can accept or not. Every now and then we need to create teams from all the participants. To make it easy I created this little app.

## Preparations
To make this work you need to go to your invitation in outlook on a windows machine. Go to tracking and copy the status to clipboard. Open the responses.txt, get rid of the current content and paste your clipboard. Then you can run main.py and it will give you teams with a captain and members.
